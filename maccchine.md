- typography rocks!
- maybe something with cyrillic alphabet to comment on Russian politics and/or
Russian hackers etc etc
- collecting information, spying during the conference in order to create a live
performance/art work reflecting on the whole conference, and the topics discussed
there etc etc
- "we sniff passwords" :)
- humour
- maybe perform on the last day of the conference, sort of "rewinding" then what
happened in the past days
- hacking the conference of hackers! ("we can build our own podium")
- "generative performance"
- "our strength is in the reflection"
- 

We are researchers from further away and we come to spy on the event. This is a difficult task, since everything that happens is part of the event and we don't want to miss anything of importance. We have to try to keep track of everything. We are used to hard work, but for two people alone it would be an impossible task. So we built a machine that gathers as much data as it possibly could and provides us with analysable output. The machine feeds of a great variey of phenomena: images, spoken word, written word and even tiniest vibrations in the air. It can sniff incidents in the intranet, carefully extract passwords, listen to talks, and take motion pictures throughout various dimensions. In fact there is almost nothing the machine is not able to filter. What it receives will be slightly encrypted - for security reasons, we are spys after all - and presented immediatly. Since the output is distorted, we would like to explain our findings in a lighting talk before we take them home for closer examination. It is naturally not possible to specify or predict the exact findings beforehand, but we hope that by defining the system of manufacture we can give an idea of what to expect. Definitely, the strength of our machine lies in collection and reflection. The conference, the topics discussed and its participants will generate a valuable piece of memory through our machine. And we like typography.
